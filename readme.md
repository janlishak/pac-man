## Story
It began as a school project with one of my colleagues, but we invested a little more time in it as we have expected. At first, we only wanted the basic functionalities of the game, but later we have implemented quite complex algorithms for controlling the enemies in the game. In the end we were able to create quite fascinating game that resembles the game style of the original game and gives the player a satisfying experience playing it. We hope you try it out and enjoy as well. ☺️
## Installation
* game was tested with version 3.8 of python, but any python 3 version should work
* if your installation does not include graphical library tkinter you need to install it to run the game
