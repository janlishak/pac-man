 
 🐍pyhon remake of the old-school arcade 🕹️pac-man
 
 It began as a school project with one of my colagues, but we invested a little more
 time in it as we have expected. At first we only wanted the basic functionalities of the 
 game, but later we have implemented quite complex alogirithms for controlling the enemyies in the game.
 In the end we were able to create quite fascinating game that resembles the gamestyle of the original game 
 and gives the player a satsfying experince playing it. We hope you try it out and enojy as well. ☺️
 
 Installation
 
 game was tested with version 3.8 of python but any python 3 version should work
 if your installation does't include graphical library Tkinter you need to install it to run the game
