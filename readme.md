## Story
This is one of the more interesting projects I have worked when I was studying at my high school.  The challenging part of this project was to create AI that would chase the player. Each of the ghost have a different algorithm to chase the player. For example, the red ghost always takes the fastest way to the player but the cyan one tries to go ahead and block your way from the other side. 
## Installation
* game was tested with version 3.8 of python, but any python 3 version should work
* if your installation does not include graphical library tkinter you need to install it to run the game
